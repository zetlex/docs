### Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Command Line (CLI)?
<Steps>
  <Step title="Command Line (CLI)">
    If you want to install any flavour of Linux without a GUI, you will need to choose an operating system from our reinstallation button.

    All of these operating systems will give you a command line only operating system, where it is possible to install any graphical user interface after.

    ### Connecting to Your Server
    When connecting to your server without a GUI, we can either use `SSH` or `noVNC`.

    `SSH` is for connecting to your server over the SSH protocol and will require an internet connection on the server, whereas `noVNC` allows you to connect to your server without it having an internet connection. **noVNC is worse for performance and latency**, and doesn't offer text copy & pasting.

    **SSH is the best option for performance**, latency and **allows you to copy paste** between your computer and your server.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connecting via noVNC">
        Click the `noVNC` button under service managment and a new window will open.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connecting via SSH">
        You can use third-party programs to connect via SSH or just use your console.
        
      <Steps>
        <Step title="Open CMD">
          Press `Windows` and type `CMD`
        </Step>
        <Step title="Connect via SSH">
          Type `ssh root@your-servers-ip` and click **ENTER**.

          `root` shows the user you're connecting to.  
          `your-servers-ip` is replaced by the IP shown in Show Login Data
        </Step>
        <Step title="Typing in Password and Accept Fingerprint">
        You will be met by this warning.
        ![title](/images/sure.png)
        Type `yes` and click **ENTER**.

        You can now paste your password in by clicking `RIGHT CLICK` on your mouse and clicking **ENTER**.

        A SSH session should now open, if not make sure that:
        - Server is online
        - Linux is installed
        - Password is correct

        If you can't establish a connection, please contact support by [opening a ticket](https://panel.bytehosting.cloud/createticket).

  <Step title="Graphical User Interface (GUI)">
    Use the `Insert ISO` button to upload your preferred .iso file to the server.
    **We do not provide support** for the the operating systems in Insert ISO.

    Use **noVNC to connect** to the server and you should be met an installation wizard taking you through configuring the operating system.

    You will configure the operating system, like if you were installing it on a **real machine**.

    Some ISO's support **automatic network configuration**, but not all. You can find the required details under service management.
