### Choosing the Right Version of Windows Server
- **Windows Server 2012 R2:** Lightweight with basic security features; suitable for environments prioritizing performance over advanced security.
- **Windows Server 2016:** Offers a good balance of security and performance; relatively lightweight and a solid choice for many setups.
- **Windows Server 2019 - Recommended:** Provides enhanced security features but is slightly more resource-intensive; ideal for those needing stronger protection and can handle additional overhead.
- **Windows Server 2022:** Features the latest security enhancements but is the most resource-demanding; best for environments where maximum security is a priority and system resources are plentiful.

### Connecting to Your Windows Server

We want to use **remote desktop** (comes with windows) to connect our server.
Remote Desktop is **automatically enabled** on the server by default.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Finding Your Login Data">
    Go to your service by clicking Manage in the service list and click **Show Login Data**.

    You will be provied with the neccesary information to connect to your server.
    - Username: `Administrator` (always the same)
    - Password: `RandomlyGenerated`
    - IP address: `Your Servers IP`
    - Port: `3389` (always the same)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Remote Desktop Connect">
    Open the program by searching `Remote Desktop Connection` in your Windows Searchbar.

    Username: `Administrator` (should be by default)
    ![title](/images/rdp2.png)
    Click `Connect`.

    Make sure the username is `Administrator` and fill in the `password` with the password from Show Login Data.

    A remote desktop session should now open, if make sure that:
    - Server is online
    - Windows is installed
    - Password is correct
